# My FastAPI App

This is a sample FastAPI application that demonstrates the use of asynchronous API calls. It includes a main entry point file, unit tests, and a requirements file.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
my-fastapi-app
├── main.py
├── test_main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

- `main.py`: This file is the main entry point of the FastAPI application. It contains the implementation of the API endpoints and their corresponding asynchronous functions.

- `test_main.py`: This file contains the unit tests for the FastAPI application. It tests the asynchronous nature of the API calls and verifies the expected behavior of the endpoints.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required for the project. It includes the necessary packages, such as FastAPI and any other libraries used in the application.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-fastapi-app.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

Once the FastAPI application is running, you can access the API endpoints using the following URLs:

- `http://localhost:8000/`: The root endpoint of the API.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests in `test_main.py` will verify the asynchronous nature of the API calls and ensure the expected behavior of the endpoints.
